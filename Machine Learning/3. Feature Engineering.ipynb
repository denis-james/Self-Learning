    "Let's talk about the real-world challenges of machine learning! While the core concepts we've covered assume you're working with neat numerical data arranged in rows and columns, reality is often messier. That's where feature engineering comes in – it's the crucial art of transforming raw information into numerical data that machine learning models can actually understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this chapter, we'll explore practical feature engineering techniques for different types of data. We'll dive into handling categorical variables, working with text data, and processing images. Plus, we'll look at ways to create new features to enhance model complexity and deal with missing data. This whole process is known as vectorization – essentially converting diverse data types into well-structured numerical vectors that our models can work with.\n",

Consider exploring housing market data: alongside quantitative metrics like price points and room counts, you'll encounter descriptive attributes such as neighborhood designations. To illustrate, your dataset might be structured as follows:\n"
